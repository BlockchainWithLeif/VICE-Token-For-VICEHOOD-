Okay!!! Steps to setup this and deploy :)

First make sure you have Node.js installed.

1. Then make sure you have moralis account and goto the speedy nodes!
2. Find Ethereum Mainnet, and then copy the address.
3. Now goto metamask, make sure you have your Ropsten wallet open, then go into settings, find the private key.
4. In the project make a file called "secret.json" (PUT IN MAIN FOLDER)
5. Now run npm install! This will take a second.
6. Make sure you have hardhat by running 'npx hardhat' in the project.
7. Make sure you have enough ether in your wallet to cover expenses. Then thats it!
8. Now run in terminal 'npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_vicehood.js --network ropsten'
9. Wait for the block to be finished, then your contract should be visible on etherscan Ropsten.
10. Verify the contract by pasting the contents of the file in 'flattened-contract': 'output.sol' into the place for the .sol contents.
11. Then everything should be fine on etherscan :)
